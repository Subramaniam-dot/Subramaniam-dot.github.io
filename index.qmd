Hey there! I'm Subramaniam, or Subro to friends, currently navigating the intricate world of software engineering with a keen eye on AI and machine learning's horizon. My adventure in tech began with an insatiable curiosity about how data can be transformed into smart decisions, leading me down a path filled with code, cloud, and countless learning moments.

After wrapping up my MSc in Big Data Science from Queen Mary University of London—proudly with a distinction—I dove headfirst into the professional realm, eager to apply my academic insights to real-world puzzles.


When I'm not coding or cloud-wrangling, I love demystifying AI and machine learning for anyone willing to listen. Whether through blog posts, discussions, or just casual chats over coffee, I'm all about sharing what I know and learning from others. After all, isn't that how we all grow?

If you're ever curious about AI, machine learning, or just want to exchange notes on the latest in tech, drop me a line at <subramaniamsmurugesan@gmail.com>. Let's make AI not just a tool for the few, but a resource for the many. Who knows what we can achieve together?

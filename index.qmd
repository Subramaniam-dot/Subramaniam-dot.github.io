Hey there! I'm Subramaniam, or Subro to friends, currently navigating the intricate world of software engineering with a keen eye on AI and machine learning's horizon. My adventure in tech began with an insatiable curiosity about how data can be transformed into smart decisions, leading me down a path filled with code, cloud, and countless learning moments.

After wrapping up my MSc in Big Data Science from Queen Mary University of London—proudly with a distinction—I dove headfirst into the professional realm, eager to apply my academic insights to real-world puzzles. My journey kicked off at SASTRA University, where my fascination with bioinformatics first took root. It's been a whirlwind of discovery and growth since then, pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo.

The meat of my work these days involves playing around with Python and AWS at Carpediem Solutions for BBC Global Services, where I'm part of a brilliant team making automation and efficiency our battle cry. Before that, I dipped my toes in machine learning waters with Fellowship.AI, experimenting with stable diffusion models. Every step of the way, I've been fueled by the challenge of making technology simpler and more accessible for everyone.

My evenings are often spent thinking about my days as a Programmer Analyst Trainee at Cognizant, where I first cut my teeth on the nitty-gritty of software development. Or, you might find me mulling over my latest publication on using neural networks for TB prediction—a nod to my belief in tech's power to make a real difference, especially in healthcare.

When I'm not coding or cloud-wrangling, I love demystifying AI and machine learning for anyone willing to listen. Whether through blog posts, discussions, or just casual chats over coffee, I'm all about sharing what I know and learning from others. After all, isn't that how we all grow?

If you're ever curious about AI, machine learning, or just want to exchange notes on the latest in tech, drop me a line at <subramaniamsmurugesan@gmail.com>. Let's make AI not just a tool for the few, but a resource for the many. Who knows what we can achieve together?

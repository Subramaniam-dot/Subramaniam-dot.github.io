    "text": "Hey there! I’m Subramaniam, or Subro to friends, currently navigating the intricate world of software engineering with a keen eye on AI and machine learning’s horizon. My adventure in tech began with an insatiable curiosity about how data can be transformed into smart decisions, leading me down a path filled with code, cloud, and countless learning moments.\nAfter wrapping up my MSc in Big Data Science from Queen Mary University of London—proudly with a distinction—I dove headfirst into the professional realm, eager to apply my academic insights to real-world puzzles. My journey kicked off at SASTRA University, where my fascination with bioinformatics first took root. It’s been a whirlwind of discovery and growth since then, pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo.\nThe meat of my work these days involves playing around with Python and AWS at Carpediem Solutions for BBC Global Services, where I’m part of a brilliant team making automation and efficiency our battle cry. Before that, I dipped my toes in machine learning waters with Fellowship.AI, experimenting with stable diffusion models. Every step of the way, I’ve been fueled by the challenge of making technology simpler and more accessible for everyone.\nMy evenings are often spent thinking about my days as a Programmer Analyst Trainee at Cognizant, where I first cut my teeth on the nitty-gritty of software development. Or, you might find me mulling over my latest publication on using neural networks for TB prediction—a nod to my belief in tech’s power to make a real difference, especially in healthcare.\nWhen I’m not coding or cloud-wrangling, I love demystifying AI and machine learning for anyone willing to listen. Whether through blog posts, discussions, or just casual chats over coffee, I’m all about sharing what I know and learning from others. After all, isn’t that how we all grow?\nIf you’re ever curious about AI, machine learning, or just want to exchange notes on the latest in tech, drop me a line at subramaniamsmurugesan@gmail.com. Let’s make AI not just a tool for the few, but a resource for the many. Who knows what we can achieve together?"

    "text": "The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) with e-health records is creating a new era of advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, which is reshaping the modern landscape of healthcare. In this paper, we propose a neural networks-based smart e-health application for the prediction of Tuberculosis (TB) using serverless computing. The performance of various Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning is evaluated to prove that this technique holds promise for enhancing the capabilities of IoT and e-health systems in the future for predicting the manifestation of TB in the lungs. The work involves training, validating, and comparing Densenet-201, VGG-19, and Mobilenet-V3-Small architectures based on performance metrics such as test binary accuracy, test loss, intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 score. The findings hint at the potential of integrating these advanced Machine Learning (ML) models within IoT and e-health frameworks, thereby paving the way for more comprehensive and data-driven approaches to enable smart healthcare. The best-performing model, VGG-19, is selected for different deployment strategies using server and serless-based environments. We used JMeter to measure the performance of the deployed model, including the average response rate, throughput, and error rate. This study provides valuable insights into the selection and deployment of ML models in healthcare, highlighting the advantages and challenges of different deployment options.

    "text": "The Unseen Powerhouses: GPUs and Parallel Computing\nHistorically, the realm of AI was dominated by large research institutions and corporations with access to significant computational resources. This began to change with the advent of General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Initially designed to accelerate graphics rendering, GPUs have emerged as pivotal in AI development. Their ability to perform massive data parallel computing tasks efficiently makes them ideal for the complex calculations required in AI, particularly in neural network training.\nResearch by Lin et al. [1] highlighted GPUs’ cost-effectiveness and superior performance, achieving speeds up to 14.74 times faster than traditional CPU implementations for exact pattern matching. This capability has revolutionized the way AI models are trained, allowing for more sophisticated and accurate systems.\nMoreover, the computing research community, as noted by Keckler et al. [2], faces the challenge of scaling in single-chip parallel computing systems. The exploration into heterogeneous high-performance computing systems, incorporating GPUs, is a testament to the ongoing efforts to address these computational demands."

    "text": "Making AI Accessible: The Role of Platforms\nThe democratization of AI has been significantly propelled by platforms offering access to powerful computational resources. Google Colab stands out as a beacon of accessibility, providing a free and fully configured runtime for deep learning applications. This platform reduces execution times dramatically by utilizing GPU parallelism, a game-changer for processing large-scale data across various research domains.\nShariar and Hasan’s work [3] on “GPU Accelerated Indexing for High Order Tensors in Google Colab” exemplifies the practical benefits of this approach. By implementing an Index Partitioning Algorithm (IPA) and a Scalable Tensor Structure (STS), they demonstrated how to enhance tensor indexing and data processing efficiency on Google Colab, leveraging GPU parallelism for better performance and load balancing."
